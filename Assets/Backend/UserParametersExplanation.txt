Line 1: freq = Starting frequency. Lowest frequency
Line 2: freqInc = Frequency increment. How much the frequency gets multiplied by for each of the vertical steps. Highest frequency will be freq * (freqInc ^ 15)
Line 3: Number of horizontal steps
Line 4: Milliseconds between steps, so total loop time will be horizontal step number * milliseconds
